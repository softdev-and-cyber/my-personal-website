    <p><strong>Passionate about cybersecurity and IT in general</strong>, I earned my DUT in Computer Science in 2022 and am on track to graduate from École 2600 in August 2025. Driven by creativity, I’m eager to join a motivated team where I can contribute to ambitious projects centered around software development and cybersecurity challenges, starting September/October 2025.</p>
    <p><strong>With a solid background in both software development and cybersecurity</strong>, I’m equally open to roles as a developer or a cybersecurity specialist. I’m especially drawn to projects where these two fields meet — but I also value opportunities that allow me to go deeper into one or the other. While I still have much to learn as a developer, I humbly share my skills, projects, and aspirations through this personal website.</p>
